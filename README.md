# Private-chat using MEAN stack

This project is a simple private chat application using MEAN stack and socket.io for making real-time applications, 
by this project i have trying to learn some basic concepts of node.js (route, unit test, password encrypt, token based authentication , real-time communication etc ..).

Express - Used for server create and setup , routing. For real-time communication used socket.io.
Mocha and Chai - For unit testing. Bcryptjs -Uused for password encryption/ decryption.

Jsonwebtoken - Used for token based authentication.
Mongojs - To access MongoDB. 

MongoDB - To store chat history and user information after registration / login.
